# Week 1

1. Image of a compact set is compact under a continuous function
2. None
3. $U \subseteq Y \subseteq X$. Then if $U$ is open in $Y$, and $Y$ open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$. An example where this doesn't hold is $X = \mathbb{R}$, $Y = [0,1], U = [0,1)$.
4. Any subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff
5. $(X,\tau_X)$, $Y = X/\sim$, and $q:X\to Y$ a quotient map, then $\tau_Y=\{U \in Y|q^{-1}(U) \in \tau_X\}$ is a topology.
6. Any composition of quotient maps is also a quotient map
7. $G$ a group, for any $g,h \in G$ the *commutator* is $[g,h] := ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$.
   The *commutator subgroup* $[G,G] \leq G$ generated by the set of all commutators $\{[g,h]: g,h\in G\}$. 
	- $[G,G]$ is trivial $\iff$ $G$ is abelian
	- $[g,h]^{-1} = [h,g]$
	- $[G,G] \trianglelefteq G$
	- $G/[G,G]$ is abelian (called *abelianisation*)
	- If $N \trianglelefteq G$ such that $G/N$ is abelian, then $[G,G] \subseteq N$.
8. None
9. $S$ finite and $S'$ infinite sets. Let $F,F'$ be free abelian groups on $S,S'$ respectively. Then $F \not \cong F'$.
