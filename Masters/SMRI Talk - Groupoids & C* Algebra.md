> **Abstract:** Whatever $C^*$-algebras are, what they do is “linearise’” topological and dynamical data a la representation theory. The problem is that while every $C^*$-algebra can in principle be realised as a collection of linear operators on Hilbert space, this has, in general, the same sort of descriptive power as the observation that every group can, in principle, be realised as a group of permutations—and for the same reason: the set of which it is a group of permutations is…itself. Groupoids provide a means of “seeing” a coordinate system in a $C^*$ -algebra. I’ll try to outline how, and why this might be useful.

**Banach Space:** Complete normed vector space

$C^*$-**algebra:** Set with algebraic operations: 
1. addition (commutative, associative), 
2. multiplication (associative)
3. multiplication by scalars
4. involution $a^* \mapsto a$ by $(a^*)^* = a$

Another abstract def: A Banach-* algebra where $\|a^*a\| = \|a\|^2$

- when represented on $\mathcal{H}$, they link algebra and geometry

**GNS Thm:** A commutative $C^*$ algebra, $a \mapsto a^*$ is an isomorphism $A \cong C(\hat{A})$  where $\hat{A} = \{?-homms: A\to \mathbb{C}\}$

**Morita context:** ?


**Groupoid:** Small category with inverses (like a grp but mult partially defined) 

**Cartan algebra:**
