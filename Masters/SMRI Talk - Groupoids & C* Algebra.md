> **Abstract:** Whatever $C^*$-algebras are, what they do is “linearise’” topological and dynamical data a la representation theory. The problem is that while every $C^*$-algebra can in principle be realised as a collection of linear operators on Hilbert space, this has, in general, the same sort of descriptive power as the observation that every group can, in principle, be realised as a group of permutations—and for the same reason: the set of which it is a group of permutations is…itself. Groupoids provide a means of “seeing” a coordinate system in a $C^*$ -algebra. I’ll try to outline how, and why this might be useful.
