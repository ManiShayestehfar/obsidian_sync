# Quiver Representation

>[!def] Quiver Representation
>$Q$ a quiver, then a **quiver representation** of $Q$ is given by the pair of sets $$W:=((W_v)_{v\in\mathcal{V}}, \:(W_\epsilon)_{\epsilon\in\mathcal{E}})$$
>where $W_v$'s are vector spaces indexed by vertices of $Q$, and $W_\epsilon$'s are linear maps indexed by oriented edges of $Q$ such that for every edge $\epsilon \in \mathcal{E}$: $$W_\epsilon : W_{s(\epsilon)} \to W_{t(\epsilon)}$$

**Thin Representation:** rep $W$ such that $W_v =\mathbb{C}$ for all $v \in V$.
