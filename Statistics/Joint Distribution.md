Suppose two measurements $X$ and $Y$ are take for each $\omega \in \Omega$

The join pmf of $X$ and $Y$ is 
$$p_{XY}(x,y) = P(X=x,Y=y)\quad x,y\in \mathbb{R}$$
where $\{X=x, Y=y\} = \{\omega: X(\omega)= x, Y(\omega)=y\}$ .

If $X$ and $Y$ are discrete RV:

Similarly

- $p_X$ and $p_Y$ are called the **marginal pmf**.

## Examples

### Simple Example
A fair coin is tossed 3 times

- $\Omega = \{HHT, HTH, ...\}$
- $|\Omega| = 2^3 = 8$ 

Let $X = 1_{\{\text{heads on first toss}\}} = \# \:\: \text{of heads in first toss}$,  $Y = \text{total}\:\#\:\text{of heads}$.
