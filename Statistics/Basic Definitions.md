## Sample Space

The set of all possible outcomes is the **sample space** $\Omega$.
- A point $\omega \in \Omega$ is a **sample point**

### Examples
1. Rolling a die: $\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
2. Coin flip: $\Omega = \{H,T\}$

## Events

**Events** are subsets of $\Omega$ to which we can assign a probability. 
- An event $A$ has occurred if the outcome, or sample point $\omega \in \Omega$ satisfies $\omega \in A$. 


## de Morgan Laws
$$(A\cup B)^{c}= A^{c}\cap B^c$$
$$(A \cap B)^{c}= A^{c}\cup B^c$$
