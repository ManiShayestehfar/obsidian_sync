>[!info] Definition
>A collection of subset s of $\Omega, \mathcal{F},$ is a $\sigma-algebra$ if:
>1. $\sigma \in \mathcal{F}$
>2. $A \in \mathcal{F} \implies A^{c}\in \mathcal{F}$ 
>3. $A_1,A_{2,...}\in \mathcal{F} \implies \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\in \mathcal{F}$ (w.r.t a countable union)

## Example

Let $\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Then $\mathcal{F}$ = power set of $\Omega$ = $2^{\Omega}$  



Hi Dani, I had some update to my Masters degree that I thought I should let you know as my supervisor. I have been having an awful experience with enrolment, and in short, as it stands I need to extend my BoS by a semester before officially starting Masters. This means that I currently cannot take the Rep theory course, but I intend to self-study alongside the course. I hope this doesn't really affect our project progress. I will be reading papers, am happy to join Journal Clubs and discussions, or anything else expected from a Masters student in the algebra group. I am really chasing after the faculty, and I hope it gets solved by the end of the week, but you probably know how this uni works better than me...
