>[!example] Context
>A certain gene has two variants in the population: a major allele (variant) “$A$” and a minor allele “$a$”. 
>
>Each individual carries two copies of the gene in their genome so their genotype is therefore one of: $AA, Aa,$ or $aa$.
>
>Under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumption the gene frequencies are at an equilibrium and it follows that $AA, Aa, aa$ occur in the population with corresponding frequencies $(1 − \theta)^2$ , $2\theta(1 − \theta)$, $\theta^2$ where $\theta$ is the frequency of the minor allele $a$.

If the population is entirely homogeneous then we can imagine artificially creating an embryo by randomly drawing individual chromosomes or alleles from the population:

$$\begin{align*}
P(M\to a, F\to a) &= \theta \cdot \theta = \theta^2 \\[5pt]
 
P(M\to a, F\to A) + P(M\to A, F\to a) &= \theta(1-\theta) + \theta(1-\theta) = 2\theta(1-\theta)
\end{align*}$$


# Estimating $\theta$

- Analyse a sample from population of Hong Kong
- The sample surveyed the genotype of the $MN$ blood group producing two types of antigens in red blood cells.
- This gene is made of two “co-dominant alleles”, i.e., genotype = phenotype, or "What You See Is What You Get".
