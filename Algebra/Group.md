>[!info] Definition
>A **group** is an ordered pair $(G, \ast)$ where:
>
>1. **Closure:** For every $a, b \in G$, the result of the operation $a \ast b$ is also in $G$.
>2. **Associativity:** For every $a, b, c \in G$,
   >$$
   (a \ast b) \ast c = a \ast (b \ast c)$$
>3. **Identity Element:** There exists an element $e \in G$ (called the identity) such that for every $a \in G$,
 >$$
   e \ast a = a \ast e = a.
   $$
   >4. **Inverse Element:** For every $a \in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \in G$ such that
   $$
   a \ast a^{-1} = a^{-1} \ast a = e.
   $$

- If the operation $\ast$ is **commutative** (i.e., $a \ast b = b \ast a$ for all $a, b \in G$), then the group is called an **abelian group**.
