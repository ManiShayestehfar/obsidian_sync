If $W$ and $V$ are [[FG-Module|submodules]], then we can form a **quotient module** 
$$V/W =\{v+W\:|\:v\in V\}$$

- We know that $V/W$ is a [[vector space]], but is also a [[FG-Module|G-Module]].

# First Isomorphism Theorem

Suppose $\varphi: V\to W$ is a $G$-module homomorphism. Then 
$$V / \ker \varphi \cong \text{im }\varphi$$
as $G$-modules.
