>A Field is a commutative [[Ring]] $R$ with $R^{\times} = R\backslash \{0\}$ 

## Characteristic of a field

>[!def]
>The characteristic of a ring/field is the smallest positive number $n$ such that:
>$$\underbrace{1+\dots+1 = 0}_{n\:\text{summands}}$$
>
>If $n$ does not exist, then the ring/field has characteristic $0$.

# Facts

>[!proposition]
>Let $R$ be a non-zero ring. The following are equivalent:
>1. $R$ is a field
>2. The only ideals of $R$ are $(0)$ and $(1)= R$
>3. Every ring homomorphism is either zero or injective
