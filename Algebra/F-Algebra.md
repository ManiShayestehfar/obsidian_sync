>[!info] Definition
>A (unital) **$\mathbb{F}$-Algebra** is a [[ring]] $R$ with identity element $1_R$ which is also a $\mathbb{F}$-vector space w.r.t addition in $R$.

>--> An $\mathbb{F}$-algebra is a ring with its *coefficients* in $\mathbb{F}$.

>A **finite dimensional $\mathbb{F}$-algebra** is an $\mathbb{F}$-algebra that is finite dimensional as an $\mathbb{F}$-vector space.

# Examples

- $\mathbb{F}G$ is an $\mathbb{F}$-algebra
- So is $\text{Mat}_n(\mathbb{F})$

# $\mathbb{F}$-Algebra Homomorphism

>[!info] Definition
>An $\mathbb{F}$-Algebra **homomorphism** is a [[Vector Space]] homomorphism $\varphi: A \to B$ that is also a ring homomorphism.

- Two algebras are **isomorphic** if there is a bijective algebra homomorphism between them
