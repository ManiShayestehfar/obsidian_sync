# $\mathbb{F}$-Algebra Homomorphism

>[!def]
>An $\mathbb{F}$-Algebra **homomorphism** is a [[Vector Space]] homomorphism $\varphi: A \to B$ that is also a ring homomorphism.

- Two algebras are **isomorphic** if there is a bijective algebra homomorphism between them


# Irreducibility

- An $\mathbb{F}$-algebra $A$ is **semisimple** if the [[Representation|regular representation]] of $A$, which is the algebra $A$ considered as an $A$-module, is semisimple.

>[!proposition]
>Suppose $A$ is a semisimple $\mathbb{F}$-algebra and let $V$ be an $A$-module. Then $V$ is semisimple.
##### Proof
By Artin-Wedderburn Theorem, $A$ is decomposable into $A = D_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus  D_t$ where each $D_i$ is a simple left-ideal (or $A$-modules) of $A$.
Now consider $AV = \{av:a \in A, v \in V\}$. This is a subspace of $V$ generated by all $A$-actions. But $V$ is already built up from $A$. Hence $V = AV = D_1V + D_2V + \cdots + D_tV$ where each $D_iV = \{d_i\cdot v:d_i \in D_i, v \in V\}$ is a submodule of $V$.

Now to examine $D_iV$, choose a basis $\{e_1,...,e_n\}$ for $V$, and define $D_ie_a := \{d\cdot e_a:d\in D_i\} \subseteq V$.
Supposing $D_ie_a \neq 0$, $D_i$ map nontrivially into $V$, and the image is the submodule $D_ie_a$. Hence $D_i \cong D_ie_a$ because the map $d \mapsto d\cdot e_a$ is:
- A nonzero $A$-module homomorphism $D_i$ (a simple module) to $D_i e_a$
- Hence by [[Schur's Lemma]], the image must be isomorphic to $D_i$.

Hence we showed that $V = \sum_{i,a}D_ie_a$, which is not necessarily direct. Suppose $D,D'$ are distinct irreducible submodules of $V$. Then either $D=D'$, or $D \cap D' = \{0\}$. So we can refine the $D_ie_a$ pieces into a direct sum,
$$V = \bigoplus_{i,a} D_ie_a.$$
This proves that $V$ itself is also semisimple.       $\square$



# Schurian $\mathbb{F}$-Algebra

>[!def] 
>An $\mathbb{F}$-Algebra, $A$, is **Schurian** if $\text{End}_A(D) \cong \mathbb{F}$, for all simple $A$-modules $D$. 


# Opposite Algebra

>[!def] 
>Let $B$ be an $\mathbb{F}$-algebra. The **opposite algebra** of $B$ is the $\mathbb{F}$-algebra $B^{op}$ that is equal to $B$ as an $\mathbb{F}$-vector space but with multiplication $a\cdot b = ab$ where the multiplication on the left-hand is in $B^{op}$ and multiplication on the right-hand side is in $B$.

## Some Properties

>[!lemma] 
>Let $A$ be an $\mathbb{F}$-algebra. Then $A \cong \text{End}_A(A)^{op}$.
>Also if we consider $A$ as a *right* $A$-module then the statement becomes $A \cong \text{End}_A(A)$.

# Artin-Wedderburn Decomposition

>[!thm]
>Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field and suppose that $A$ is a semisimple Schurian $\mathbb{F}$-algebra. Let $d_1,...,d_t$ be the dimensions of the irreducible $A$-modules, counted up to isomorphism. Then 
>$$A \cong \text{Mat}_{d_1}(\mathbb{F}) \oplus \cdots \oplus \text{Mat}_{d_t}(\mathbb{F})$$ 
##### Proof
[ENTER PROOF]

>[!corollary] 
>Suppose $\mathbb{F}G$ is Schurian, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a field of characteristic $p$ such that $p \nmid |G|$. Let $d_1,d_2,...,d_t$ be the dimensions of the irreducible $\mathbb{F}G$-modules, counted up to isomorphism. Then $|G|= d_1^2+\cdots +d_t^2$.
##### Proof

By [[Maschke's Theorem]] $\mathbb{F}G$ is a semisimple $\mathbb{F}$-algebra. Hence, this follows by taking dimensions on both sides of the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of $\mathbb{F}G$.
