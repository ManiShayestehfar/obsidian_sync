An **Associative algebra** over a field $k$ is a vector space $A$ over $k$ equipped with a multiplication operator  $x,y \to xy$ for $x,y \in A$ with properties:

1. **Associativity:**   $x(yz) = (xy)z$   for $x,y,z \in A$ 

2. **Bilinearity:**   for $x,x',y,y' \in A$  and  $\alpha \in k$

	- $(x+x')y = xy + x'y$ 
	- $x(y+y') = xy + xy'$
	- $(\alpha x)y = x(\alpha y) = \alpha(xy)$

There is always a unit such that $1 \cdot x = x \cdot 1 = x$  for all $x \in A$

# Examples

-  $\textrm{End}\:V$ is an associative algebra of linear operators from a vector space $V$ to itself.
