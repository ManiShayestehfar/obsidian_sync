# Free Product

>[!def] Free product
>Let $\{G_i \:|\: i \in I\}$ bet a collection of groups. Let $G$ be a group, and for each $i \in I$, let $\varphi_i: G_i \to G$ be a homomorphism.
>Say $G$ is the **free product** of $G_i$ w.r.t. $\varphi_i$ if for any group $H$ and for any collection of homs. $\psi_i:G_i \to H$, there exists a *unique* homom. $f:G \to H$ such that $\forall i \in I$  TFDC:

- Denote this by $G = \ast_{i \in I} G_i$
- Uniqueness follows from the same proof as [[Free Product of Groups]]


# Word

>[!def] Word
>A **word** in groups $G_i$ is a finite sequence $(x_1,...,x_n)$ such that
>1. each $x_i$ is a nontrivial elements of some $G_j$
>2. $x_i,x_{i+1}$ belong to distinct $G_j$
>- A word is **empty** if the sequence is $()$.

>[!def] Actions on words
>$W$ the set of all words in $G_i$. We define an action of each $G_i$ on $W_i$. Let $g \in G_i$. Then:
>1. If $g=1,\quad g\cdot(x_1,...,x_n)= (x_1,...,x_n)$ and $g\cdot() = ()$
>2. If $g\neq 1,\quad g\cdot () = (g)$
>3. If $g \neq 1, \quad x_1\not\in G_i,$ then $g\cdot(x_1,...,x_n) = (g_,x_1,...,x_n)$
>4. If $g \neq 1,\quad x_1 \in G_i$, then $g\cdot(x_1,...,x_n) = (gx_1,...,x_n)$
>5. If $g \neq 1$, and $x_1 = g^{-1} \in G_i$, then $g\cdot(x_1,...,x_n) = (x_2,...,x_n)$ 

>[!proposition] 
>Define $G \leq \text{Sym}(W)$ generated by all of $G_i$. Then $G_i \leq G$ for all $i \in I$. Let $\varphi_i: G_i\overset{i}{\hookrightarrow}G$ the corresponding inclusions. Then any element of $g\in G$ can be expressed as a finite product: $$g=g_1\cdots g_n$$
>where either:
>1. The product is empty ($\iff g = 1$), or
>2. each $g_i$ belongs to $G_i\backslash\{1\}$ for some $i$, and $g_i,g_{i+1}$ are distinct in $G_i$s.

- Products that follow (1) and (2) are in **reduced form**.

>[!claim]
>The reduced form for a $g \in G$ is unique, i.e. if $g =g_1...g_n=h_1...h_m$ then $m=n$ and $g_i=h_i$
##### Proof
Act $g$ on the empty word $()$, get $(g_1,...,g_n)= (h_1,...,h_m) \implies m=n$, etc. $\square$

**Note:** if $g = g_1...g_n$ is in reduced form, then $g^{-1}=g_n^{-1}...g_1^{-1}$ is reduced.
If $g'=g_1'...g_m'$ is also reduced, then $gg' = g_1...g_ng_1'...g_m'$ (not necessarily reduced)

>[!claim]
>$G$ (as defined above) is the free product $\ast_{i\in I} G_i$
##### Proof
With respect to the universal property of free objects, $\varphi$ is inclusion for all groups $H$, and for all $\psi_i: G_i \to H$.  

Let $g \in G$ with (unique) reduced form $g_1...g_n$. Define $f$ by $f(g) = \psi_1(g_1)\psi_2(g_2)...\psi_n(g_n)$ where each $i_k \in I$ such that $g_k \in G_{i_k}$. 
- Need to check that this is in fact well defined and the only homom. such that the diagram commutes. 
$\square$

## Example

$G_1 = \{a^n |a\in \mathbb{Z}\}, G_2 = \{b^n |b\in \mathbb{Z}\}$. Then $G = G_1 \ast G_2$ has elements $g = a^{n_1}b^{m_1}...a^{n_k}b^{m_k}$ for $n_j,m_j \in \mathbb{Z}$ where possibly $m_k =0$ for $k\geq1$, and all other $n_j,m_j$ are non-zero.


# Free Group

- Similar universal property except now we have
