# Degree

>[!lemma] 
>Any group homomorphism $f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ must be $f(z)=dz$  for some $d \in \mathbb{Z}$.
##### Proof
Let $d=f(1)$. Then, $f(n) = nf(1) = dn$ for $n >0$, and $f(-n)=nf(-1)=(-d)n$.  $\square$


>[!def] 
>Let $n>0$. Consider a map $f:S^n\to S^n$. The induced map $f_*:H_n(S^n) \to H_n(S^n)$ must be of the form $f_*(z) = dz$ for some $d \in \mathbb{Z}$. 
>We call $d$ the **degree** of $f$, denoted $\deg f$.

## Properties

1. $\deg \mathbf{1} = 1$
2. If $f$ is not surjective, $\deg f = 0$. 
   **Proof:** $\exists x_0 \in S^n\setminus f(S^n)$ such that 
   ![[Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.56.46 pm.png]]
   $\implies f_* =0\implies \deg f = 0$. $\square$

3. If $f \simeq g$, then $\deg f = \deg g$.
   **proof:** $f \simeq g \implies f_* \simeq g_* \implies \deg f = \deg g$

4. a) $\deg(f \cdot g) = \deg f \cdot \deg g$
   b) If $f$ is a homotopy equivalence, then $\deg f  = \pm 1$.
   **Proof of a:** Since $(f\cdot g)_* = f_* \cdot g_*$, then the result holds
   **Proof of b:** $\exists \:g$ such that $f \cdot g = 1\implies \deg f \cdot \deg g = \pm1$.


# Reflections & Fixed Points

>[!def] 
>A **reflection** along a hyperplane sends a point $x$ to a point $y$ such that $d(x)=d(y)$ for $d$ the distance from the hyperplane
>- Think of it as projection on to a plane and then reverse-project on the other side.
>- A reflection is a reflection along a hyperplane (intersected with a sphere)

![[Degree Theory-1760529927822.png|300]]

- Think of mirroring a point from one hemisphere to another, and preserving the points intersecting with the hyperplane, which is the boundary of the hemispheres and a subspace $S^{n-1}$.
- E.g. $[x_0,...,x_{i-1},x_i,x_{i+1},...,x_n] \longmapsto [x_0,...,x_{i-1},-x_i,x_{i+1},...,x_n]$ is a reflection.

**Important note:** The antipodal map $S^n \to S^n$ given by $x \mapsto -x$ is NOT a reflection. It does not preserve *every* point.

>[!proposition]
>The antipodal map on $S^n$ has $\deg f = (-1)^{n+1}$
##### Proof
**Claim 1:** The antipodal map is $(n+1)$ reflections
**Claim 2:** Every reflection has degree $-1$

Make a $\Delta$-complex structure on $S^n$ with $U, L$, gluing to body by identifying the boundary.
$\ker \partial_n$ is generated by $U-L$ and $\text{im }\partial_{n+1}=0$. Hence $H_n^\Delta(S^n)$ is generated by $U-L$.
For  $f_*(U-L) = f(U)-f(L) = L-U= -(U-L)$ and therefore $\deg f = -1$. $\square$


>[!proposition]
>If $f:S^n \to S^n$ has no fixed points, then $\deg f = (-1)^{n+1}$.
##### Proof

 >[!lemma]
 > For any $f:S^n \to S^n$, either:
 > 1. $\exists \:x_0$, $f(x_0)=x_0$, or
 > 2. $f$ is homotopic to the antipodal map
###### Proof
Suppose $f(x)\neq x$ for all $x$.
Define $g:S^n \times I \to S^n$ by $g_t(x) = \frac{(1-t)f(x)-tx}{|(1-t)f(x)-tx|}$.
Hence $f$ is homotopic equivalent to the antipodal map. Else, condition (1) holds. $\square$

By lemma, $\deg f = \deg(\text{antipodal map})= (-1)^{n+1}$.  $\square$




## Theorems

>[!Theorem]
>Any *even* map $f:S^n \to S^n$ must have *even* degree.
>- If $n$ is even, then $\deg f=0$.

>[!Theorem] Barsuk-Ulam Theorem
>Any *odd* map $f: S^n \to S^n$ must have *odd* degree if $n$ is odd.
