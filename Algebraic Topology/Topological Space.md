>1. $\emptyset, X \in \tau$ 
>2. Arbitrary union of sets from $\tau$ is in $\tau$

Elements of $\tau$: open sets, $V \subseteq X$ is **closed** if $X\backslash V \in \tau$.

# Examples

## Subspace Topology

If $(X,\tau_x)$ is a topological space, and $Y \subseteq X$, then the **subspace topology** on $Y$ is $\tau_Y = \{U\cap Y | u \in \tau_x\}$

## Product Topology

$X \times Y = \{(x,y) | x \in X, y \in Y\}$ has a **product topology** with base $\{U \times V|U \in \tau_x, V \in \tau_y\}$/
e.g. $\mathbb{R}^2 = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$

## Quotient Topology

Suppose we have an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$ with equivalence class $[x]$. Define $Y := X/\sim = \{[x] \:|\: x \in X\}$ "set of all equivalence classes".  

# Compactness

>[!def] 
>$(X,\tau)$ is **compact** if every open cover has a finite subcover. i.e. if $X = \bigcup_{i \in I} u_i$ for $u_i \in \tau$, then there exists $i_1,...,i_n \in I$ such that $X = \bigcup_{i=1}^n u_i$

## Heine-Borel

>[!thm]
>$Y \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is compact $\iff$ it is closed + bounded


# Hausdorff

>[!def] 
>A Top space is **Hausdorff** if $\forall x,y \in X$, $\exists U,V \in \tau$ such that $x \in U, y \in V$, and $U \cap V = \emptyset$.
>
- Any metric space is Hausdorff as we can use the metric to find the distance between two points and construct non-intersecting balls centered at those points.

# Connectedness & Path-Connectedness

>[!def] 
>A Top space is **connected** if it cannot be expressed as a disjoint union of two non-empty open subsets.

- e.g. $S^0$ is not connected, but for $n\geq 1$ $S^n$ is connected

>[!def]
>A **path** $p$ in $X$ is a [[Continuity (Top)|continuous]] map $p:[0,1] \to X$

>[!thm] 
>$X$ is **path-connected** if $\forall x,y \in X$, there exists a path $p$ in $X$ with $p(0)=x$ and $p(1)=y$.

- Path connected $\implies$ connected


# Homeomorphism

>[!def] 
>$f:X\to Y$ is a **homeomorphism** if:
>1. $f$ is continuous
>2. $f$ is bijective
>3. $f^{-1}$ is continuous

- if there exists such a homeomorphism, then $X \cong Y$.


# Union

>[!def]
>$X \sqcup Y$ the **disjoint union** forms the topology $\tau_{X\sqcup Y} = \{U \sqcup V \:|\: U \in \tau_x, V \in \tau_Y\}$


# Cone

>[!def] 
>The **cone** of $X$ is $CX= (X \times [0,1]) / (X \times \{1\})$


# Suspension

>[!def] 
>$SX = (X \times [-1,1]) / (X\times \{1\}, X \times \{-1\})$


# Join

>[!def] 
>$X * Y$ joins every point of $X$ to every point of $Y$.
>$X * Y = X \times Y \times [0,1] / \sim$
>- $(x,y,0) \sim (x,y',0)\quad\quad \forall x\in X, y,y' \in Y$
>- $(x,y,1) \sim (x',y',1)\quad\quad \forall x,x'\in X, y \in Y$
>  
>  We also have associativity: $(X*Y)*Z = X*(Y*Z)$


# Wedge Sum

>[!def]
>Fix $x_0 \in X$, $y_0\in Y$. $X \vee Y = X \sqcup Y / (x_0=y_0)$ 


# Direct Product

>[!def] 
>The **direct product** $\prod_{i \in I} G_i$ is the group with elements $g: I \to \sqcup_{i \in I} G_i$  such that $g(i) \in G_i$ for all $i \in I$, and group operation defined by $(gh)(i) = g(i)h(i)$.

i.e. the multiplication is component-wise

>[!def]
>The **direct sum** $\bigoplus_{i\in I}G_i$ is defined similarly with the extra requirement that $g(i)=1$ for all but finitely many $i \in I$.

For *finite* $I$, the direct sum and product are equivalent.


# Simply-Connected

>[!def] Simply-Connected
>For $X$ path-connected, $X$ is **simply-connected** if $X$ is path connected and $\pi_1(X)\cong 1$.


# Locally Path-Connected

>[!def] 
>$X$ is **locally path-connected** if for all $x \in X$ and all open neighbourhoods $U$ or $x$, there exists an open neighbourhood $V$ of $x$ with $V \subseteq U$ such that $V$ is path-connected.

# Semi-locally simply-connected

**Recall:** Simply connected $\implies$ path-connected + trivial $\pi_1$ 

>[!def]
>A space $X$ is **semi-locally simply-connected** if every $x \in X$ has an open neighbourhood $U$ such that the map $\pi_1(U,x) \to \pi_1(X,x)$ induced by $U \hookrightarrow X$ has trivial image. 
>i.e. every loop in $U$ based at $x$ is nullhomotopic in $X$.

## Examples

$S^1$ 

## Non-examples

Hawaiian earring embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$ 

## Properties

>[!lemma] 
>If $X$ has a simply-connected covering space $\widetilde{X}$, then $X$ is semi-locally simply-connected.
##### Proof

==DO THE PROOF==


# Good Pair

>[!def]
>$A \subseteq X$. Say $(X,A)$ is a **good pair** if $A$ is 
>1. non-empty
>2. closed
>3. DR of some open set in $X$

## Examples

1. $X =D^n, \:\: A=\partial D^n = S^{n-1}$
2. $X$ a CW-complex, $A$ a non-empty subcomplex


# Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

>[!theorem]
>Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group. Then  $$G \cong \mathbb{Z}^n \oplus \mathbb{Z}/k_1\mathbb{Z} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}/k_d \mathbb{Z}$$

- The **rank** of $G$, $\text{rank } G = n$ 

# Euler Characteristic

>[!def] 
>Let $X$ be a finite CW-complex. The **Euler characteristic** $\chi(X)$ is 
>$$\chi(X) = \sum_n (-1)^n c_n$$
>where $c_n = \#$ of n-cells of $X$.

## Theorem

>[!theorem] H Theorem 2.44
>$$\chi(X) = \sum_n (-1)^n \text{ rank }H_n(X)$$

- This is saying that the Euler characteristic is independent of the chosen CW-structure.

- Why is $H_n(X)$ a finitely generated abelian group? From a previous corollary, $H_n(X)$ is generated by at most $k = \#$ n-cells of $X$. Hence $H_n(X)$ is finitely generated abelian so we can work with the rank.

>[!lemma]
>If $0 \overset{}{\longrightarrow}A \overset{}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{}{\longrightarrow}C$ is short exact, $A,B,C$ is finitely generated abelian groups, then $\text{rank }B = \text{ rank }A + \text{ rank }C$
##### Proof of Theorem 2.44
Consider the sequence
$$0 \overset{}{\longrightarrow}\overbrace{H_k(X^k,X^{k-1})}^{C_k}\overset{}{\longrightarrow}H_{k-1}(X^{k-1},X^{k-2})\overset{}{\longrightarrow}\cdots \overset{d_1}{\longrightarrow}H_1(X^1,X^0)\overset{d_0}{\longrightarrow}H_0(X^0)\overset{}{\longrightarrow} 0 $$
We have the short exact sequence  $$0 \overset{}{\longrightarrow}\ker d_n \overset{}{\longrightarrow}C_n \overset{d_n}{\longrightarrow}\text{im }d_n \overset{}{\longrightarrow}0$$ and $$0 \overset{}{\longrightarrow}\text{im }d_{n+1}\overset{}{\longrightarrow}\ker d_n \overset{}{\longrightarrow} \underbrace{\ker d_n/\text{im }d_{n+1}}_{H_n(X)} \overset{}{\longrightarrow}0$$
By lemma above, $\text{rank }C_n = \text{rank }(\text{im }d_{n+1}) = \text{rank }d_{n+1} + \text{rank }d_{n}$.

$\text{rank }C_n = c_n = \#$ n-cells of $X$. DO THE REST OF THE PROOF

### Example (Torus)

$$H_n(T^2) = \begin{cases}
\mathbb{Z} & n=0,2  \\
\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} & n= 1 \\
0 & n\geq 3
\end{cases}$$
$\chi(T^2) = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0 = 2 - 2\times 1$ where the last $1$ is the genus of the torus

In general $M_g =$ closed orientable surface of genus $g$ (one 0-cell, $2g$ 1-cell, one $2$-cell). Then $\chi(M_g)= 2-2g$. 

For $S^n$, $$\chi(S^n) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{for n odd}  \\
2 & \text{for n even}
\end{cases}$$
