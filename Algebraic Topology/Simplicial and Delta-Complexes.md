# N-simplex

>[!def]
>An **n-simplex** in $\mathbb{R}^m$ for $m\geq n + 1$ is the convex hull of $n+1$ ordered points $v_0,v_1,...,v_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$ such that the vectors $v_1-v_0, v_2-v_0, ... , v_n - v_0$ are linearly independent. 
>Call $v_0,...,v_n$ the **vertices** and write $[v_0,...,v_n]$ for the (ordered) simplex.
