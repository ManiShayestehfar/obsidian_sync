Let $X$ be a $\Delta$-complex

# n-Chain

>[!def] 
>For $n \geq 0$, an **n-chain** is a finite formal sum $\sum_\alpha k_\alpha e_\alpha^n$ where $k_\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}$ and each $e_\alpha^n$ is an open n-simplex in $X$. 
>- Write $\Delta_n(X)$ for the set of all n-chains.

- Equivalently we can write n-chains as the finite formal sums of character maps $\sum_\alpha k_\alpha \sigma_\alpha$.

## n-chains as Free $\mathbb{Z}$-mod  

>[!lemma] 
>$\Delta_n(X)$ is a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module (i.e. a free abelian group) with addition as group operation.

- A basis for $\Delta_n(X)$ is set of all open n-simplices, or equivalently, their characteristic maps
