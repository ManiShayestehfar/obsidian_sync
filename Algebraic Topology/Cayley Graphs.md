Given a presentation $G=\langle S|R\rangle$ we can construct a 2D cell complex $X_\alpha$ with $\pi_1(X_G)\cong G$ by 
- one vertex $X_G^0=\{v\}$, $X_G^1=\bigvee_{S_\alpha\in S} S_\alpha^1$  (a bouquet of circles)
- Attach a 2-cell $e_r^2$ for each relator $r \in R$.

e.g. $G =\langle a,b\:|\:aba^{-1}b^{-1}\rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$, then

# Cayley Graph

## Properties of Cayley Graphs

1. At each vertex, degree in = degree out = $|S|$
2. $\Gamma(G,S)$ is path-connected as every $g \in G$ is a product of elements of $S\cup S^{-1}$
3. If $w = s_{i_1}s_{i_2}...s_{i_k}$ is a word in $S \cup S^{-1}$ such that $w = 1$ in $G$, then any edge path $(g, gs_{i_1}, gs_{i_1}s_{i_2},...,gw)$ is a *loop* in $\Gamma(G,S)$.
	- In particular, all relators give loops in $\Gamma(G,S)$.


# Cayley Complex

>[!def]
>For $G = \langle S|R\rangle$, the **Cayley Complex** $X_G$ is 
>- 2D cell-complex with 1-skeleton the Cayley graph $\Gamma(G,S)$, and 
>- for every $r \in R$, a 2-cell attached to each loop in $\Gamma(G,S)$ with edges labelled as $r$.
>i.e. one 2-cell for each $(g,r)\in G \times R$.


## Examples

1. $\mathbb{Z}= \langle a | -\rangle$ and $F(a,b) = \langle a,b|-\rangle$ then $X_G = \Gamma(G,S)$ as there are no relators.

## Propositions

>[!proposition]
>$\widetilde{X}_G$ is simply-connected and therefore a universal cover of $X_G$
##### Proof

Since $\Gamma(G,S)$ is path-connected, then so it $\widetilde{X}_G$. We give a sketch proof of why $\pi_1(\widetilde{X}_G)\cong 1$. 

Let $[f]\in \pi_1(\widetilde{X}_G)$. Homotope $f$ to lie in the 1-skeleton, $\Gamma(G,S)$. So $f$ gets labeled with the trivial word $w$ in $G$. i.e. $\Pi_{i=1}^k g_ir_ig_i^{-1}$.  Consider the loop labelled $f_i = g_ir_ig_i^{-1}$ in $\Gamma(G,S)$. Then $[f_i]= 1$ in $\pi_1(\widetilde{X}_G)$ because of the 2-cell for $r_i$ and $g_i$. Since $f = f_1\cdot f_2 \cdot ... \cdot f_k$ then we get $[f]=1$ in $\pi_1(\widetilde{X}_G)$.  $\square$

# $K(G,1)$ Spaces

>[!def] 
>Let $G$ be a group. The **$K(G,1)$ Space** is a path-connected space $X$ such that 
>- $\pi_1(X)=G$  
>- $X$ has a contractible universal cover

## Examples

1. $S^1$ is a $K(\mathbb{Z},1)$, $\pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ universal cover $\mathbb{R}$ is contractible.
2. $T^2$ is a $K(\mathbb{Z}^2,1)$, $\pi_1(T^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$ universal cover $\mathbb{R}^2$ is contractible.
3. $S^1 \vee S^1$ is $K(F(a,b),1)$ with universal cover an infinite tree. $\Gamma(F(a,b), \{a,b\})$ (trees are contractible).
4. *Non-example:* $\mathbb{R}P^2$ is NOT a $K(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z},1)$ as universal cover $S^2$ is NOT contractible


## Induced $K(G,1)$ space

>[!thm]
>Homotopy type of $K(G,1)$ that is a CW-complex is uniquely determined by $G$.

>[!Proposition] 
>$X$ a connected CW-complex and let $Y$ be a $K(G,1)$. Then every homomorphism $\varphi: \pi_1(X,x_0) \to \pi_1(Y,y_0)$ is induced by a continuous map $f:(X,x_0)\to (Y,y_0)$ that is unique up to a homotopy fixing $x_0$.
##### Proof (of prop)

###### Case $X^0 = \{x_0\}$ 
Existence of $f$ such that $f_*=\varphi$: Define $f(x_0) = y$. Let $e^1_\alpha$ is a 1-cell of $X$. Then $e_\alpha^1$ is a loop at $x_0$ so $[e_\alpha^1] \in \pi_1(X,x_0)$.  Define $f(e_\alpha^1)$ to be a loop in $Y$ that represents $\varphi([e_\alpha^1])$. 

Since the $[e_\alpha^1]$ generate $\pi_1(X,x_0)$, this defines $f$ on $X^1$. Let $e_\beta^2$ be 2-cell in $X$ with attaching map $\varphi_\beta:S^1 \to X^1$. We can define $f$ on the interior of $e_\beta^2$ provided $f$ is continuous and $f\circ   \varphi_\beta$
is nullhomotopic in $Y$.

For $n\geq 3$, If $\psi_\gamma: S^{n-1} \to X^{n-1}$ is the attaching map, then 

![[Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 10.37.00 am.png|550]]

Since $n\geq 3$, $\pi_1(S^{n-1})\cong 1$ so $(f \circ \psi_\gamma)_*(\pi_1(S^{n-1}))\subseteq p_*(\pi_1(\widetilde{Y}))$ so we get a lift $\widetilde{f \circ \psi_\gamma}$. But $\pi_1(\widetilde{Y})\cong 1$ so $\widetilde{f \circ \psi_\gamma}$ is null-homotopic in $Y$. Hence we can define $f$ on $X^n$ as well.

###### Case $X^0$ not a single vertex:

Choose a maximal tree $T \subseteq X^1$. Define $f$ on each edge in $X^1\setminus T$ as before, since $\pi_1(X^1,x_0)$ is generated by the loops containing these edges. Extend over higher dimensional cells as above. Uniqueness proof is similar. $\square$



##### Proof (of Thm)

$X,Y$ CW-complexes, both $K(G,1)$s. Then there is an isomorphism $\varphi:\pi_1(X,x_0) \to \pi_1(Y,y_0)$. By proposition above, $\varphi$ is induced by the continuous map $f:(X,x_0) \to (Y,y_0)$, and similarly for $\varphi^{-1}$ induced by $g$. Now
$$\begin{align*}
(g \circ  f)_* &= g_* \circ f_* = \varphi^{-1} \circ \varphi = 1_{\pi_1(X,x_0)} \\[2pt]
(f \circ  g)_* &= f_* \circ g_* = \varphi \circ \varphi^{-1} = 1_{\pi_1(Y,y_0)}
\end{align*}$$
By uniqueness in the proposition above, then $g \circ f \simeq \text{id}_X$ and $f \circ g \simeq \text{id}_Y$. There fore $X,Y$ are homotopy equivalences. $\square$
