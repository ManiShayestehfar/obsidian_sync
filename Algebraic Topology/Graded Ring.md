>[!Definition] Graded Ring
>Let $A$ be a ring. $A$ is a **graded ring** if $$A = \bigoplus_{k\geq 0}A_k$$
>with $A_k$ additive subgroups such that $A_k\times A_\ell \to A_{k+l}$

## Examples

1. Polynomial ring $R[x]$ is a graded ring
   $$R[x]=\bigoplus_{n \geq 0} \left(\sum_{i=0}^n r_i x^i\right) = \bigoplus _{n\geq 0} R[x]/(x^n)$$
2. Also $R[x]/(x^n)$ is obviously a graded ring itself
